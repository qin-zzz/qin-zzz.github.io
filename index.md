Qin got her bachelor’s degree in Engineering from <a href="https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/">South China University of Technology</a> in 2018. She’s currently a second-year master’s student at <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/">Eurecom</a>, France, **seeking a 6-month internship on privacy enhanced technologies**.

<p>
Prior to France, she briefly worked in the supply chain field for companies like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tp-link-corporation-limited/">TP-LINK</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dji/">DJ-Innovations</a>, where she participated in challenging projects addressing the surge demand during COVID-19 pandemic (partly attributes to the rise of remote work and platforms like TikTok) and strategic planning on regions like Africa and Middle East. Her early career experiences exposed her to significant transitions, thus she is aware of the importance of optimism and adaptability.
</p>

<p>
The first disappointed	truth about her is that she’s a last-minute decision-maker. This trait may have led to missed opportunities, but she’s still alive and enjoys her life, so she’s not going to change too much :)
</p>

<p>
Another facet of her personality is that she’s an INFP/INTP, which indicates a tendency towards idealism rather than realism and traditional employment roles. MBTI is an easy way to judge a person if you are not going to spend time knowing more about them, but she prefers not to do that.
</p>

<p>
Despite her quirks, she possesses admirable qualities such as courage and frankness. For instance, last summer, she did a solo driving trip spanning 4000km in France and discovered the major cities and lesser-known villages with locals. After the trip, she opened her studio in South France to female travellers. Till now, she’s welcomed over 20 guests aging from 18 to 65. They speak French, Italian, English, German, Turkish, Danish, Korean as well as Mandarin. They are social worker, biologist, nun, gap-year high school girls and graduate students.
</p>

<p>
In summary, she’s a lucky and vibrant person according to her friends. Now she’s looking for solutions to the rescue of people who lives alone, which involves various technological domains.
