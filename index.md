<p>
  Welcome! My name is Qin ZHENG. I am a first-year master's student specializing in Computer Science, with a focus on Data Science & Engineering at <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/">Eurecom</a>, located in Sophia Antipolis, France. In 2018, I completed my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/">South China University of Technology</a>, where I studied a wide range of topics including mathematics, bussiness, economics and computer science. 
</p>

<p>
  I spent four dynamic years honing my skills in the vibrant city of Shenzhen, China, woking in companies such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tp-link-corporation-limited/">TP-LINK</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dji/">DJ-Innovation</a>, as well as a startup specializing in IT solutions. 
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I am particularly intrigued by the convergence of machine learning with domains like economics and cybersecurity.
