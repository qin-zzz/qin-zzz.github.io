    description: 25H is like the superhero of time management apps. It takes tasks from your messages, emails and even the course schedules on your phone under your permission and assigns them a cozy spot in your day. But it's not just about organizing your time. 25H is all about positive reinforcement. When you conquer a task, it doesn't just silently check off the box; it throws a virtual party! And, if you ever want to take a stroll down memory lane, 25H keeps a track record of all your triumphs. It's like a highlight reel of your productivity, showing you just how awesome you've been over time. [Update (April 2024): Permissions and privacy issues, gotta be redesigned..]

    description: KoAlert is like a guardian angel for solo warriors in the world. Just like koalas, who are often solo artists, many people are navigating life alone nowadays. KoAlert steps in when trouble hits, acting as a lifeline. "Ko" stands for cooperation, and "Alert" is the beacon of help. With wearable devices and other methods, it shoots out distress signals to chosen contacts or even nearby good Samaritans. It's a safety net that turns loneliness into a team effort for survival.[Update (April 2024): MVP finished.]

    description: Picture this-a building's on fire, or it's aftermath of an earthquakeâ€”traditional navigation won't cut it. But enter 5G magic! This semester project dives into how 5G can revolutionize indoor navigation, especially when teamed up with a smart robot. Think of it as a search dog guiding firefighters through chaos, making rescue missions smoother and more effective. [Update (April 2024): my part involved deep learning has finished, it contributes to Mohsen's research.]
