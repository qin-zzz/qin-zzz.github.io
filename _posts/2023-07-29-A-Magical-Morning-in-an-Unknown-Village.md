La Serpent, a quaint village boasting a mere population of 40 residents, has etched itself into my story by the whispering winds that guided me here...

One particular morning, around six o'clock, sleep eluded me, departing from the habits of old. Drawn by curiosity, I ventured beyond the confines of my teepee to witness the world outside. To my astonishment, a dense fog had woven its embrace around the village, imbuing it with an unfamiliar aura. With my camera in tow, I embarked on an impromptu morning stroll.

As I meandered closer to the vineyards, the sun unveiled itself, casting a luminous glow upon the landscape and dancing with the mist to create an otherworldly tableau. The vineyards beckoned, and as I stepped forth, a sight of exquisite beauty unveiled itself â€“ a spider's delicate creation, adorned with morning dew, glistening like fragile crystals in the first light of day.
