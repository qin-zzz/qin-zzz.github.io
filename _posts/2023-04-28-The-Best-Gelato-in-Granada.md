After a whole day of walk, I was on my way back to the hostel. Then appeared an unusual scenerio, people were lining up in front of a store. I asked a man who was about to leave, he was looking at the gelato in his hand contentedly. "Is it the best gelato here?" "Maybe." He smiled. So I joined the line. Then an elderly man joined and lined up behind me. We looked at each other and smiled. After ten minutes I got my gelato as well. I believe it the best gelato, it comforts at least two people who travel alone.
