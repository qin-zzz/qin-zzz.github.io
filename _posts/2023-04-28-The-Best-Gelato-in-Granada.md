As the day drew to a close and my weary feet carried me back to the hostel, an unexpected sight unfolded before meâ€”a gathering of people forming a line outside a humble store. Curiosity piqued, I approached a man who was savoring a gelato in his hand, his expression radiating contentment. 

*"Is it the best gelato here?"* I inquired. With a smile that held a hint of mystery, he responded, *"Maybe."*

Intrigued, I joined the queue. To my delight, an elderly gentleman joined the line behind me, and we exchanged knowing smiles. After a brief but patient wait, I finally held my own gelato in hand. It was a taste that transcended mere sweetness; it was a comforting indulgence that silently connected two solitary travelers, filling our hearts with warmth and companionship.
