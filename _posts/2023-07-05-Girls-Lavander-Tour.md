On the first day of my road trip in France, I set off to pick up two friends at 6:00am. It was an exciting moment as it marked the first time we would meet in person. They had originally planned to visit Valensole but were unable to find a car. That's when I came into the picture. We had connected through social media, and together, we decided to embark on this adventure.

Although I didn't have much experience driving on freeways, with only a couple of short trips to Nice totaling about 20km, today was different. I found myself confidently driving at high speeds, overtaking numerous cars along the way. To my surprise, I discovered that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. However, the real challenge awaited us on the zigzagging and treacherous mountain roads.

As we maneuvered through the mountains, there came a moment when we encountered a sharp downhill turn. I misjudged the speed and failed to steer accurately, causing my friends to momentarily feel the weightlessness of gravity. But instead of panic, a brief silence was followed by infectious laughter, as if their amusement dissolved any tension in the air. To lighten the mood further, we turned up the music and allowed ourselves to relax. It was a reassuring moment.

Interestingly enough, this trip marked the first time all three of us embarked on an all-girls adventure. Despite occasional detours and moments of being lost, we chose not to complain. Instead, we worked together to find our way back onto the right path.

During one of our rest stops in a lavender field, we crossed paths with two female motorcyclists from Spain. They exuded a sense of empowerment and freedom. It was a reminder that we, too, were free women, fearlessly exploring the world and embracing the unknown.
