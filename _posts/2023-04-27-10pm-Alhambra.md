This is one of my favorite photos during my stay in Granada. At 10 pm, the tourists were looking at the Alhambra under the lights from the Saint Nicolas viewpoint. Then a couple of musicians started playing flamenco and attracted two kids to come dancing. After the music ended, the little ones sat down between two adults and began talking with each other. At one moment, two of them looked into the sky hopefully.
