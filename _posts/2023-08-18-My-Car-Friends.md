After a month of driving, I have conquered my fear of being behind the wheel. This newfound confidence led me to embark on the longest journey of my life just yesterday â€“ a remarkable 700km drive from Landes to Normandy. Throughout this remarkable odyssey, I was treated to a breathtaking panorama of nature's wonders: from the golden embrace of morning light in the pinewoods to the cool refuge under the shade of Plane trees; from the bustling city center traffic to the tranquil expanses of an empty freeway, culminating in my triumphant arrival at the intended destination.

During this voyage, I formed fleeting bonds with fellow travelers on the road, our cars becoming temporary companions. These serendipitous connections emerged as we navigated through a two-hour standstill in traffic, or seamlessly followed one another's lead, ensuring a harmonious pace. Our paths might diverge at the whim of a traffic light or a roundabout, yet the companionship of these newfound friends elevated the journey's experience, and for that, I am genuinely grateful.
