After a month of driving, now I am not afraid of driving any more. However, yesterday I went on the longest journey in my life, I drove a distance of about 700km, from Landes to Normandy. I went through all the beautity. From the pinewoods in the morning light to the shadow of Plane tree, from the traffic in the city center to the freeway with nobody, and finally arrived at my destination.

I became the tempory friends of some cars. We came to know each other because we stuck in the traffic for two hours, or we followed each other so that we are neither too fast or too slowly. We might lose each other after a traffic light or a roundabout. But I am happy to have them with me for such a journey.
